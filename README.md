***Welcome to the home of your group's TIETA12, part 2 coursework code and documentation!***

This README.md file is where your group writes your project plan/project report.

When you write it, you must use Markdown. [Documentation for GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html).

The directory structure of the code is up to your group to decide, but this README.md file must remain in place.
